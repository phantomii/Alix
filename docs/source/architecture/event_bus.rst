Intro
=====

The Event Bus is one of realization publish-subscribe pattern. Publishâ€“subscribe
is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not
program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called
subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without
knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers
express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of
interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are. See more
information in 
`WIKI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern?>`_.

The event bus has two API methods for subscribing and firing events. The first
is a subscribe method. The subscribe method accept EventType parameter and
returns a Queue if no errors. All events equals with passed event type will be
posted to this queue. A subscriber should check the queue on new events for
itself. Only new events will be posted to the queue after a subscriber subscribe
on a event. The second is a fire method. The fire method accept event object and
returns none if no errors. The below in sequence section you can see more
